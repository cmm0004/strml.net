>>> I'm Candice, 
#
# I live and work in Atlanta, Ga where I spilt my time between
# work, learning haskell in my local Starbucks, spending time 
# with friends, and feeding my cat.
#
# I work best in Agile Teams of 4-5 and am intelligent, confident, 
# and assertive in my opinions of software best practices; my design background
# gives me unique perspective on projects. I can communicate with 
# both technical and non-technical and am capable of detailed oriented 
# work while asking the right questions about the bigger picture to
# keep projects not only on track, but ensuring they meet user need.
